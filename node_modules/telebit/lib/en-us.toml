ssh-proxy = "Proxying SSH over HTTPS

Wrapping SSH in HTTPS makes it accessible anywhere and also makes it routable.
Whether inside a harsh network environment or even if hindered by a poorly
configured firewall, once wrapped in tls, ssh becomes UNSTOPPABLE.

Usage:
        telebit ssh <remote> [ssh flags and options]

Example:

        telebit ssh jon.telebit.io

It is NOT at all neccessary to use \"telebit ssh\", it's just a convenience.
Wanna know why, and the alternatives? Keep reading!

## History

When TLS sends an encrypted packet over the network it begins with a handshake
which shows the things like the tls version and the host SERVERNAME unencrypted
so that the remote server can respond with the correct certificate.

SSH was created well before TLS and has a completely different header. The good
news is that, unlike some other early internet protocols, it does have a header
with its name and version, but it doesn't have anything to identify the server.

##  Telebit + SSH

Here's why:

When you're running ssh through an https tunnel (as telebit does) you
can't just use \"ssh me.example.com\" to get in. You have to tell ssh that you
want to use an https tunnel. Using \"telebit ssh\" as a client will specify
all of the correct ssh options.

However, when you want to connect to ssh over https, you either have to pass
the correct arguments or modify your ~/.ssh/config to use \"openssl s_client\".

We explain the different configurations below:

## SSH + openssl

The configuration that's most likely to work with what's already installed on
your machine is this:

        Host jon.telebit.io
          ProxyCommand openssl s_client -quiet -connect %h:443 -servername %h

Or you would call ssh directly, like this:

        ssh jon.telebit.io -o ProxyCommand=\"openssl s_client -quiet -connect %h:443 -servername %h\"

It's rather simple, but it looks quite daunting.

## SSH + sclient

Because that looks a little hairy, we created \"sclient\", so that the example
could look a bit more digestible:

        Host jon.telebit.io
          ProxyCommand sclient %h

Or

        ssh jon.telebit.io -o ProxyCommand=\"sclient %h\"

## Inverse SSH Tunnel (same as stunnel)

The commands above instruct ssh to open a pipe into openssl or sclient. If we
instead want to connect ssh to a local tunnel, it looks like this:

        Host jon.telebit.io
          Hostname localhost
          Port 3000
          HostKeyAlias jon.telebit.io
          CheckHostIP no
          RequestTTY force

Or

        ssh localhost -p 3000 -t -o CheckHostIP=no -o HostKeyAlias=jon.telebit.io

tcp = "Telebit TCP - Seemless connectivity to LEGACY apps.
Use 'telebit http' instead, where possible (including for ssh).

usage: telebit tcp <path/port/none>

        tcp <local> [remote]          forward tcp to <local> from <remote>
        ex: telebit tcp 5050 6565     ex: forward tcp port 6565 locally to port 5050

        tcp <path> [remote]           show ftp-style directory listing
        ex: telebit tcp ~/Public      ex: show listing of ~/Public

        tcp none [remote]             disable tcp access for [remote] port
        ex: telebit tcp none 6565     ex: remove access to port 6565

Use cases:

        - Debugging plain TCP when troubleshooting a legacy app
        - You can't install a secure client (like telebit, sclient, openssl, or stunnel)

See also sclient <https://telebit.cloud/sclient> for connecting to legacy apps
with telebit-upscaled secure https access."

rsync = "Telebit (Client) rsync - Sync files to or from another computer

Sync files and directories from one computer to another.

Usage:

        telebit rsync [flags] <src> <dst> [arguments]
        ex: telebit rsync -av home.jon.telebit.cloud:shared/ ~/shared/ --exclude=tmp

This is not a full implementation of rsync, but rather a convenience wrapper
around rsync which passes the correct options to ssh for https tunneling.

Due to the way telebit wraps rsync, all flags which take an argumnt must
go after the source and destination paths / addresses.

vpn = "Telebit (Client) vpn - Use with Firefox for UNSTOPPABLE web browsing

This provides a very easy-to-use, lightweight VPN known as Socks5 that can be
used directly by Firefox and Chrome without requiring administrator privileges.

Usage:

        telebit vpn --socks5 <port> <remote>
        ex: telebit vpn --socks5 6789 home.jon.telebit.io

The flags are:

        --socks5 <port> You MUST specify the socks5 port

Firefox Configuration:

        Firefox -> Preferences
        Advanced -> Network
        Connection -> Settings

        Manual proxy configuration:

        SOCKS Host: localhost
        Port: 6789
        SOCKS v5

Just like a full vpn client, it routes your IP traffic places through the VPN
server (which in this case is another one of your telebit devices), but only
for traffic in the configured browser. You can still access school and office
resources in the other browser (and other applications) the need to switch a
full VPN on and off.

As will all other telebit functionality, this use https tunneling and will not
be disrupted by unfavorable network conditions.

Use cases:

        - Watch your US Netflix using your home IP while traveling abroad.
        - Log into your router as if from inside your home network.
        - Disregard poorly configured web proxies at school or work.

ftp = "Telebit (Client) Secure FTP

Alias of \"telebit rsync\"

The original FTP was superseded by sftp and then rsync a few decades ago,
however, sometimes we refer to its successors, generically, as \"FTP\"
(just like you might say \"hang up\" the phone).

## History

FTP is a legacy of the 1970s. It served its purpose well on local networks, but
was extremely dangerous on the Internet due to its lack of security and various
vulnerabilities. On some legacy systems it remains an easy target to steal
passwords and load viruses onto computers.

Although very few systems have ftp installed today (thank goodness), almost every
computer comes with rsync already installed and ready to go.

Use \"telebit rsync\" instead."
